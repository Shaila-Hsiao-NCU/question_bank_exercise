The Court didn't specify what \"significantly younger\" meant, but O'Connor had been replaced by someone 16 years younger."

She said her boss propositioned and threatened her with demotion if she did not respond. He did not carry out the threats, and she was promoted. Therefore, in quid pro quo cases it is not necessary for the employee to suffer a tangible job action (such as a demotion) to win the case."

        "answer": "TRUE",
        "explanation": "The restricted policy approach means demonstrating that the employer's policy intentionally or unintentionally excluded members of a protected group.

        "explanation": "A selection rate for any racial, ethnic, or sex group which is less than four-fifths or 80% of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded as evidence of adverse impact. In this example, Shippers Express hires 80% of male applicants, but only 50% of female applicants. Four-fifths of 80% would be 64%. Since 50% is less than 64%, adverse impact exists."
