In a brief essay, explain the point\nmethod of job evaluation and why it is problematic for firms in regards to comparable worth.\nAnswer: The point method is a quantitative technique. It involves identifying (1) several\ncompensable factors, each having several degrees, as well as (2) the degree to which each of\nthese factors is present in the job. Assume there are five degrees of \"responsibility\" a job could\ncontain. Further, assume you assign a different number of points to each degree of each factor.\nOnce the evaluation committee determines the degree to which each compensable factor (like\n\"responsibility\" and \"effort\") is present in the job, it can calculate a total point value for the job\nby adding up the corresponding points for each factor. The result is a quantitative point rating for\neach job. Comparable worth has implications for job evaluation. Virtually every comparable\nworth case that reached a court involved the use of the point method of job evaluation. By\nassigning points to dissimilar jobs, point plans facilitate comparability ratings among different\njobs. Perhaps the wisest approach is for employers to price their jobs as they see fit (with or\nwithout point plans), but to ensure that women have equal access to all jobs.
