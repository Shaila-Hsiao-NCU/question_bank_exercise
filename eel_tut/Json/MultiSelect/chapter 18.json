        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A) It's not until a company reaches the 100-employee milestone that it can afford a\nhuman resources specialist, so owners conduct most HR tasks. All businesses have HR tasks no\nmatter the size, but small firms focus more on finance, production, and marketing issues. HR at\nsmall firms tends to be informally handled."
